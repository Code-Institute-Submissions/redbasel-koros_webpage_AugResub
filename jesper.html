            <h3>Training philosophy</h3>
            <p>
                My training philosophy is based on finding a balance between benefit and pleasure in order to find the
                optimal well-being.
                The way there looks different from person to person depending on what conditions and what motivation you
                have.
                I advocate quality over quantity every day of the week and this applies to all of my clients.
                By finding a plan around exercise & diet that suits you, the journey towards your goals will go faster
                than you ever could have imagined.
                You will be injury free, have a lot of energy and more zest for life.
            </p>
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                Proper execution and "give it a little extra" is the key to getting maximum development in your
                training.
                If you do this for 30 minutes, you will get much better results than if you train half-heartedly for 2
                hours.
                I advocate a lot of strength training. This is where you build muscle, get strong, get rid of injuries
                and get a better fat burning.
                As cardio training, I encourage HIIT (high-intensity training).
                Train hard for 10-15 minutes with strength exercises and short rest.
                With this type of training, you get better condition and at the same time build muscle.
                The more muscle you have the more fat you burn!
            </p>
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
                To achieve your goals, you need to find a diet that suits your lifestyle.
                The diet should work in your everyday life and you should like the food.
                If it becomes too complicated, it will not be long-lasting and it will be easy to fall back into old
                habits.
                I eat a diet that is basically very healthy. I then alternate the healthy food with junk food and
                snacks in smaller quantities to get to my life balance.
                I do not want to give you a strict diet that you are unhappy with. I want to help you find a
                long-lasting lifestyle that you love and want to live with for life.
                Calories are not everything, your well-being is.
            </p>
            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>
                Sleep is at least as important as diet and exercise for good results.
                The body needs its sleep for the mind to be rested and for the muscles to recover.
                While you sleep, the muscles build up & you burn fat.
                If you exercise a lot, you need to sleep more.
                I follow the guidelines that you should sleep 7-9 hours every night to get maximum recovery.
            </p>
