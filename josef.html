      <h2>Josef Andersson</h2>
      <p> I have always wanted to help others by knowing how, what and why to do things.
        My goal is to convey my knowledge to you so that you can move as well as you can, become as strong as
        possible and get the best possible results!



        My philosophy is based on the Nervous System, how it controls us and how we can use the body to control
        our nervous system and our brain. If we can do it well, it will lead to better mental state, physical
        performance and less pain.

        The nervous system controls everything based on what the body sends for signals to it. In order for us
        to have good health, our nervous system needs to be well-functioning and functional. We do this through
        the right movements, exercise, diet, sleep and routines.
