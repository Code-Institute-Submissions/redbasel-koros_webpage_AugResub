      <h3>Training Philosophy</h3>
      <p> I have always wanted to help others by knowing how, what and why to do things.
        My goal is to convey my knowledge to you so that you can move as well as you can, become as strong as
        possible and get the best possible results!

        My philosophy is based on the Nervous System, how it controls us and how we can use the body to control
        our nervous system and our brain. If we can do it well, it will lead to better mental state, physical
        performance and less pain.

        The nervous system controls everything based on what the body sends for signals to it. In order for us
        to have good health, our nervous system needs to be well-functioning and functional. We do this through
        the right movements, exercise, diet, sleep and routines.
      </p>
      <h3>Nervous System</h3>
      <p>
        The nervous system is the system that allows you to experience, feel and interpret your world. Without it you do
        not exist. The nervous system is the body and the body is the nervous system.

        If you want to appreciate, love and feel good, it is important that your nervous system works well and helps you
        to interpret your surroundings, create movement and security.

        The training you do needs to be in synergy with your nervous system so that you become stronger, more flexible
        and develop.

        Your body and nervous system adapt to exactly what you do.

        If you do not move your joints often, they will lock, which will make them weaker through a reflex, which makes
        it harder for you to move, train and develop strength and energy.
